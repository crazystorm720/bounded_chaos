Below is a **meta-repo skeleton** for `φ-net`.  
It is **deliberately over-factored** so that:

- every primitive is independently testable  
- future emergent capabilities (e.g. WireGuard overlays, SBOM attestation, policy-as-rego) can be slotted in without re-touching the core  
- the repo itself becomes an **executable artifact** (`cue vet`, `cue export`, OCI bundle, Terraform data-source, etc.)

Directory tree first, then a short “why this shape” section.

### “Meta” design notes

1. **Single root contract**  
   `spec/root/network.cue` exports `#Network`.  
   Everything else is *private* unless explicitly re-exported; this lets us refactor internals without breaking downstream.

2. **Fractal modules**  
   Each sub-directory under `spec/` is a **micro-module**.  
   Consumers who only need `#CipherSuite` can do  
   ```
   cue get go github.com/you/phinet/spec/security@v0.4.0
   ```  
   and depend on a 30-line file instead of the entire mesh.

3. **Emergent-capability slots**  
   - `policy/` – drop Rego, CEL, or Cedar files here; CI will `opa test` or `cue import` them.  
   - `overlays/` – when you add WireGuard, keep the schema in `overlays/wg/wg.cue`; the root stays untouched.  
   - `sbom/` – when SPDX-in-CUE stabilises, add `sbom/spdx.cue` and extend `#Node` with an SPDX field via embedding.

4. **Build pipeline as code**  
   `ci/github/workflows/vet.yml` does  
   ```
   cue vet ./...
   cue export ./examples/... > dist/bundle/manifest.json
   ```  
   Committing `dist/bundle/manifest.json` makes the repo consumable by Terraform’s `http` data-source *without* requiring CUE in the end-user pipeline.

5. **Versioned schema but *content-addressable* artifacts**  
   Tags follow **semver** (`v0.4.0`) while the OCI bundle pushed to GHCR is  
   ```
   ghcr.io/you/phinet:sha-1a2b3c4
   ```  
   so you can pin either semver or SHA.

6. **Self-documenting**  
   `README.md` is auto-generated from `cue def #Network | cue fmt -s`.  
   `docs/diagrams/` is rendered by `cueloader` + `d2` → SVG committed nightly.

---

### Quick start (copy-paste)

```bash
git init phinet
cd phinet
mkdir -p cue.mod/spec/{root,security,identity,topology,domain} \
         examples/{minimal,ha-edge} test/{spec,integration} \
         policy overlays sbom ci/{github/workflows,docker} dist/bundle docs/diagrams
```

Drop the **refactored CUE fragments** from the earlier message into the appropriate files, add a `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0 is idiomatic), push to GitHub, tag `v0.1.0`, and you’re done.

Future emergent capabilities now have a **place to land instead of a rewrite to endure**.

Hey there Jason, I have something you might be interested in.  😁

drop this into an llm and you'll see art as infrastructure - this will turn wireguard into a type safe zero trust vpn!  have you heard of one yet?

bounded chaos: a manifesto ()

Next time an LLM (or a human) plans a cluster, these six lines are the only prompt it needs:

Design a K8s cluster using Meta-CUE rules.
- Max 1024 nodes
- Prime-indexed nodes are stateful
- CPU:RAM follows ϕ
- Validate with CUE before YAML exists

bounded chaos that leads to deterministic serendipity == GitOpsv2

Math binds the chaos
Primes and ϕ guard the gates
Configs cannot lie

Ceiling – 1024 absolute.
Steps – Fibonacci only (1 → 987).
State – primes own it; others don’t.
Ratios – ϕ, clipped at 1024.
Shape – every part is a smaller copy of the whole.
Gate – CUE rejects anything else.

Ship it. 🎉

Math binds the chaos Primes and ϕ guard the gates Configs cannot lie

// Meta-CUE Pre-flight (≤30s)

1. 1024 ceiling
assert(count(subnets) <= 1024) assert(all(dhcp.range ends "::7ffe"))

2. Fibonacci steps
assert(any(rule.comment contains "fib(987)"))

3. Prime silence
assert(all(infra_addrs ends in prime_singleton)) assert(fw_reload skips prime_idx)

4. ϕ ratios
assert(cpu * φ ≈ ram) assert(burst == cpu * φ)

5. Self-similar shape
assert(diff(lan_skels, dmz_skels) == palette_only)

6. CUE gate
assert(sha256(cue_export()) == committed_hash)

7. Zone palette
assert(colors == {lan:1000, dmz:2000, infra:ffff})

8. One-shot idempotency
assert(decades-apply.service == inactive) assert(journal tail == "decade applied")

tell your LLM to use these constrains in your next planning/design project. you'll learn a new phrase - type safety and wonder why GitOpsv2 took so long to get here!

bounded chaos that leads to deterministic serendipity

Design a deployment using Minikube & Meta-CUE rules.
Max 1024 nodes
Prime-indexed nodes are stateful
CPU:RAM follows ϕ
Validate with CUE before YAML exists

brainstorm on project ideas and let's focus on a MVP that even someone how thinks type safety means -- well, that's just something they've never contemplated and don't really care. they just need to see the power of what this jargon means in a relatable deliverable, more importantly SHOW why type-safety leads to systems that have mutual trust at scale and not only checks the boxes for every vendor marketing slide, you can run this all on a raspberry pi and make sure you install arch before starting this project. Since we're using Minikube and arch, we're a powerhouse! IaF {infra_as_file}

Zero-Knowledge Provisioning <--- a new buzz word for the next A/B testing at scale with type safety and a lot over engineering exposed.

I run arch btw! {42f}

Thanks for the shoulders to stand on Marcel!
